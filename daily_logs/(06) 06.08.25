## 3. Record ID

**Definition:** Unique Salesforce-generated identifier for every record.

**Formats:**
- 15-character ID: Case-sensitive (UI). Example: `0035g00000ABCde`
- 18-character ID: Case-insensitive (APIs). Example: `0035g00000ABCdeAAZ`

**Usage:** Required for Update, Delete, Upsert, and Undelete operations.

---

## 4. Data Import

**Purpose:** Add or update records from external sources (CSV, databases).

**Tools:**
- **Data Import Wizard:** Web-based, up to 50,000 records. Supports standard + custom objects.
- **Data Loader:** Desktop client, supports millions of records. CLI automation.
- **dataloader.io:** Cloud-based, scheduling, Dropbox/FTP integration.
- **Workbench:** Web-based, API-level operations.

**Best Practices:**
- Clean data before import
- Include required fields
- Use External IDs for Upsert
- Test with small batches

---

## 5. Upsert Operation

**Definition:** Combination of Update + Insert.

**Logic:**
- If record exists → Update  
- If record doesn’t exist → Insert

**Required:** Record ID or External ID

**Steps (Workbench):**
1. Prepare CSV with External ID or Record ID
2. Login → Data → Upsert
3. Select Object
4. Choose External ID / Id field
5. Upload CSV, map fields
6. Confirm → Run

**Tools & Methods:**
- **Data Export Wizard:** Schedule weekly/monthly, includes attachments
- **Data Loader:** SOQL filtering, bulk export, Export All
- **Workbench:** SOQL queries, export CSV
- **dataloader.io:** Scheduling and filtering

**Types of Export:**
- **Full Export:** Entire object data
- **Partial Export:** Filtered records via SOQL

## 8. Sandbox vs Production

| Feature       | Sandbox                          | Production                      |

## 10. Best Practices for Salesforce Data Management

✅ Always backup data before update or delete  
✅ Test imports/updates in Sandbox first  
✅ Use External ID for Upsert to prevent duplicates  
✅ Clean data (remove duplicates, validate formatting)  
✅ Monitor success/error CSVs after each operation  
✅ Limit batch sizes for large datasets  
✅ Use scheduled exports for regular backups
