## 1️⃣ Object Limitations in Salesforce

Salesforce objects have limits and constraints that vary by edition.

### ✅ Types of Objects
- **Standard Objects**: Provided by Salesforce (e.g., Account, Contact)
- **Custom Objects**: Created by users for specific needs
- **External Objects**: Linked via Salesforce Connect
- **Big Objects**: Designed for massive datasets (billions of records)

### ✅ Custom Object Limits (Per Org)

| Edition      | Limit  |
|--------------|--------|
| Essentials   | 0      |
| Professional | 50     |
| Enterprise   | 200    |
| Unlimited    | 2,000  |

### 🔧 Other Limits
- **Fields per object**:  
  - Standard: Up to 500  
  - Custom: Up to 800  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Max 2 Master-Detail  
  - Up to 40 total (Lookup + MDR)  
- **Tabs**: Limited per edition  
- **Big Objects**: Billions of records (read-only)

## 2️⃣ Converting Lookup Relationship to Master-Detail

Conversion is only allowed if every child record has a parent.

### ✅ Pre-Conversion Requirements
- No orphan child records
- Max 2 Master-Detail Relationships (MDR) per object
- Required permissions:  
  - Modify All Data  
  - Customize Application  
- Child object must not be a master in another MDR

### ✅ Steps to Convert
1. Go to **Setup → Object Manager → Child Object**
2. Open **Fields & Relationships → Select Lookup field**
3. Click **Edit → Change Field Type → Master-Detail** (if eligible)
4. Confirm warnings and **Save**
5. Update **page layouts and security**

### ✅ Effects of Conversion
- Child inherits ownership and sharing from parent
- Cascade delete occurs when parent is deleted
- Enables **Roll-Up Summary** fields on the parent

---

## 3️⃣ Orphan Records

**Orphan Records** = Child records without a parent (Lookup is blank)

### ✅ Why Important?
