# âœ… 4 Levels of Security in Salesforce

Security is applied at different levels to protect data and functionality:

## 1. Organization-Level Security

**Controls:** Who can log in and from where  
**Settings:**
- Login Hours  
- Login IP Ranges  
- Password Policies  
- Session Settings  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  

**Purpose:** Prevent unauthorized access to Salesforce

---

## 2. Object-Level Security

**Controls:** Which objects a user can Create, Read, Edit, Delete  
**Managed by:**
- Profiles  
- Permission Sets  

**Example:**  
A user can view Accounts, but not delete them

---

## 3. Field-Level Security

**Controls:** Which fields in an object are visible/editable  
**Managed by:**
- Profiles  
- Permission Sets  

**Example:**  
Hide the Salary field for certain users

---

## 4. Record-Level Security

**Controls:** Which individual records a user can access  
**Methods:**
- Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)  
- Role Hierarchy  
- Sharing Rules  
- Manual Sharing  

**Example:**  
A Sales Rep sees only their accounts

---

# âœ… Why Create Custom Profiles if Standard Profiles Exist?

**Standard Profiles:** Predefined, limited customization (cannot remove some permissions)  
**Custom Profiles:** Full control over object, field, and record-level permissions  

**Benefits of Custom Profiles:**
- Business-specific requirements  
- Best practice for security and flexibility  
- Easy maintenance and auditing  

**Tip:** Use Profiles for base access + Permission Sets for additional permissions

# âœ… Sharing Settings in Salesforce

## 1. Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)

**Purpose:** Baseline record access for all users  
**Access Levels:**
- Private  
- Public Read Only  
- Public Read/Write  
- Controlled by Parent  

**Example:**  
Accounts OWD = Private â†’ Users only see their own accounts

## 2. Sharing Rules

**Purpose:** Open up access beyond OWD  
**Types:**
- Owner-Based: Share records owned by one role with another  
- Criteria-Based: Share records based on conditions  

**Access Levels:**
- Read Only  
- Read/Write  

**Example:**  
Share all accounts where Industry = Banking with Finance team

---

# âœ… Role Hierarchy

**Purpose:** Grants access to records owned by users lower in the hierarchy  
**Works with:** OWD (if OWD = Private or Read Only)  

**Important Notes:**
- Does not grant object or field permissions  
- Only record visibility flows upward  

**Example:**  
CEO â†’ Manager â†’ Sales Rep  
Manager can access Sales Repâ€™s records

---

# âœ… Manual Sharing

**Purpose:** One-off sharing of a single record with a user/role/group  
**Who Can Share:**
- Record owner  
- Users above in role hierarchy  
- Admins  

**Access Levels:** Read Only, Read/Write  
**Visible When:** OWD = Private or Public Read Only  

**Example:**  
Alice manually shares her Account with Bob

---

# âœ… Queues vs Public Groups

## Queues

- **Purpose:** Assign and process records  
- **Own Records:** Yes  
- **Used For:** Leads, Cases, Custom Objects  
- **Members Can:** Take ownership of records  
- **Example:** Support Queue for cases

## Public Groups

- **Purpose:** Simplify sharing and folder access  
- **Own Records:** No  
- **Used For:** Sharing rules, reports, dashboards  
- **Members Can:** Cannot claim ownership  
- **Example:** Marketing Public Group for report sharing
