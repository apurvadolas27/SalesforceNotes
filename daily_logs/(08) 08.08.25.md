# 🔐 Salesforce System Security Overview

System Security in Salesforce ensures protection from unauthorized access and maintains data integrity.

---

## 1. 🛡️ Key Components of System Security

- **User Authentication**: Verifies identity using username, password, and MFA.
- **Authorization**: Controls access via profiles, roles, and permission sets.
- **Session Management**: Manages login sessions and timeouts.
- **Network Security**: Restricts access based on IP ranges.

---

## 2. 🔓 Login Access Policies

Define how and when users can log in.

### Features:
- **Login Hours**: Set specific time frames for login.
- **Login IP Ranges**: Restrict access to specific IP addresses.

---

## 3. ⏰ Define Login Hours for a User

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `Setup → Profiles → Select a Profile`.
2. Under **Login Hours**, define start and end times for each day.

**Behavior:**
- Users cannot log in outside login hours.
- Active sessions are terminated after login hours.

---

## 4. 🌐 Set IP Address (Login IP Ranges)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `Setup → Profiles → Select a Profile → Login IP Ranges`.
2. Add **Start IP** and **End IP**.

**Behavior:**
- Users outside the range are blocked or prompted for verification.

---

## 5. 🔑 Password Policies

Enhance security by controlling password behavior.

### Key Settings:
- Minimum password length
- Complexity requirements (letters, numbers, special characters)
- Expiration period (e.g., 90 days)
- Password history (prevent reuse)
- Lockout policy (after failed attempts)

---

## 6. ⏳ Session Timeout

Controls session duration without activity.

**Steps:**
- Navigate to `Setup → Session Settings`.

**Options:**
- 15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs, 8 hrs

**Purpose:**
- Prevent unauthorized access from idle sessions.

---

## 7. 🔐 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Adds a second layer of security.

### Factors:
- **First**: Username + Password
- **Second**: Verification via:
  - Salesforce Authenticator App
  - SMS Code
  - Email (not preferred)

---

## 8. 📱 Salesforce Authenticator App

Mobile app for MFA.

### Features:
- Push notifications
- Location-based verification

**Setup:**
- Navigate to `User Settings → Advanced User Details`
- Connect account to Authenticator app

---

## 9. 🧾 Permission Sets

Grant additional permissions without changing profiles.

### Example:
- Profile: Read access
- Permission Set: Edit/Delete access

---

## 10. ✅ Validation Rules

Ensure data quality by enforcing conditions before saving.

### Example:
AND(ISPICKVAL(StageName, "Closed Won"), ISBLANK(CloseDate))

Close Date cannot be blank if Stage is 'Closed Won'

# ⚙️ Custom Metadata Types in Salesforce

Custom Metadata Types are used to store **configurable, non-sensitive information** that supports application behavior and logic.

---

## 🧩 Purpose

Custom Metadata is ideal for storing:
- Business rules
- Default values
- Integration settings
- API keys *(not recommended for sensitive data)*

---

## 🆚 Custom Metadata vs Custom Settings

| Feature                     | Custom Metadata Types           | Custom Settings                  |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Deployable via packages** | ✅ Yes                           | ❌ No                            |
| **Used for configurations** | ✅ Yes                           | ✅ Yes                           |
| **Scope**                   | Global                          | User/org-specific                |
| **Security**                | Not for sensitive data          | Not for sensitive data           |

---

## 📦 What Type of Data Is Stored?

Custom Metadata stores **configurable information** such as:
- Tax rates
- Discount thresholds
- Integration settings

> ⚠️ **Note**: Avoid storing sensitive data like passwords or API secrets in Custom Metadata.

---

## ✅ Benefits

- Easily deployable across environments
- Supports version control
- Reduces hardcoding in Apex and validation rules

---

## 🔧 Use Cases

- Feature toggles
- Workflow configurations
- External system mappings
- Business logic parameters

---

Keep your configuration flexible, scalable, and secure by leveraging Custom Metadata Types effectively!
